Total basics: https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/ef-core-6-fundamentals/table-of-contents
Really good course about encapsulating: https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/ef-core-6-encapsulating-usage/table-of-contents
Other Vladimir Khorikov courses are also great like, I've watched: DDD and EF Core 3: Preserving Encapsulation, Domain-Driven Design: Working with Legacy Projects and really highly recommend
Really good materials, for example for different possibilities in EF you can find there: https://www.entityframeworktutorial.net/efcore/entity-framework-core.aspx but sometimes I'm using https://www.learnentityframeworkcore.com/ too; both of them are great quality courses.
And of course never beaten MSDN: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/. Tons of good materials
EF core github: https://github.com/dotnet/efcore Good way to find possible solutions for problem, not only in discussion but in current implementations.
Last but not least great usage of entity framework in Microsoft project Eshop On Containers (Orderding service has some nice features like for ex. private foreign keys): https://github.com/dotnet-architecture/eShopOnContainers
